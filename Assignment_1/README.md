# Overview
The aim of this assignment was to scrape data from a website where it was possible to search for a keyword. I chose [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/) the saviour of coding projects. In my solution to scrape the data from this site I created a function which required only two arguments: a keyword and the number of pages to download.
