# Overview
The aim of this assignment was to download as much content from a website as possible either by webscraping or using an API. In my solution I downloaded data using the [API](https://www.nobelprize.org/about/developer-zone-2/) of the [Nobel Prize website](https://www.nobelprize.org/). After downloading the data I also cleaned it and performed exploratory analysis on it.
